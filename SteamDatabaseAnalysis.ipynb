    "**Problem Statement**\n",
    "\n",
    "The topic of our project is to analyze and predict the effects of various game features on a game's popularity. In other words, predicting the popularity of a game being on sale on Steam.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the many factors that could possibly contribute to the success or failure of a game, lack of information as to how these factors truly influence a game's popularity make it difficult for game developers to developing games set up for success. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will use machine learning algorithms to identify which potential feature variables in our data has a significant relationship and impact on game popularity. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance of the Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "As new games are constantly being developed, it is important for game developers to understand which aspects of a game fuel its popularity so that they can create more successful games. Tackling this problem will allow game developers to identify, understand, and apply the factors of what makes a game popular so that they can not only create more successful games, but also save time, money, and energy in the process. This data and analysis can be effectively used for the business of games, where a gaming company can predict the sales of a game that is to be released. This skill can be used to balance the company budget, improve their game advertisement, and further understand the marketing trend of the gaming market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the aforementioned problem and its importance, we set out to tackle the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What features are significant enough to affect the prediction of all reviews if we analyze the prediction between the number of all positive reviews and the features?\n",
    "* If the popular_tags feature is significant enough to affect the prediction of all reviews, how does popular_tags affect the game popularity?\n",
    "* How does the number of all positive reviews affect the number of owners/ number of sales for the game?\n",
    "* Will the Lasso regression method have the highest testing accuracy compared to the Ridge, Knn, and the SVM regressions?\n",

    "       \n",

    "       * Null: The number of platforms supported feature and number of positive reviews have no relationship.\n",
    "       * Alternative: The number of platforms supported feature and number of positive reviews have a strong positive linear relationship.\n",
    "       \n",
